<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Aaron, and I am currently a software engineer for L3Harris technologies in the DFW metroplex. I graduated from Baylor University in May 2023 with a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. In my free time, I enjoy working out, watching movies, and hanging out with friends. </p>
