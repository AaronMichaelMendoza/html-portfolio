    <p>
      Hi! My name is Aaron, and I am currently a software engineer for L3Harris
      technologies in the DFW metroplex. I graduated from Baylor University in
      May 2023 with a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical and Computer
      Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. In my free
      time, I enjoy working out, watching movies, and hanging out with friends.
