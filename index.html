                <p>The Smart Exit Device was my EGR 4390 Senior Design Project. The client was Security Brands Inc in Dallas, TX.
                The client wanted a device that could autonomously differentiate people and vehicles from miscellaneous objects
                such as packages, animals, cars, etc. The team used an OpenMV camera with a neural network generated by EdgeImpulse.
                A LIDAR distance sensor along with a motion sensor was used in the device as well.

                <p>An Atmel SAM4L8 board was transformed into a running watch with GPS and heart rate capabilities for my ELC 4438 Embedded System Design project. My team and I had about 3-4 weeks to create this watch, and I was primarily in charge of implementing the heart rate capabilities. This project was largely inspired by my internship at Garmin, where I worked on the <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/702902">fenix 6</a>.
